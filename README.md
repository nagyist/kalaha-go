# KalahaGo
KalahaGo is a game I wrote as an university project. It's based on the popular board game Kalaha, which is also often referred to as Mancala. KalahaGo is based on the "Empty Capture" version of the game.

## Run
To run the game simply launch the KalahaGo.jar file from the command line ('java -jar KalahaGo.jar') and make sure you have the latest version of Java installed.

## Interactions
Once you configured the settings and started the game you have a few different interactions you can use.

  - Click & Hold to see where the last stone will fall into
  - Double click to make a move
  - Activating the hint mode will display the best possible move in red and show you ratings for each of your playing fields
  
## Robot
The Robot or Computer Player is based on the Minimax-Algorithm. Easy will make it think ahead by 1 turn, Medium 3 turns and on Hard it will be 5 turns ahead. Hard will need some processing power.
